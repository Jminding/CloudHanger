## Why I decided to do this project
It helps the local community, and especially the local dry cleaning businesses.
Lately, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, dry cleaners have suffered.  This app can hopefully help them streamline their business and bring customers back.

## What this app does
This app is basically a dry cleaner, but online.  A dry cleaner uploads their menu and such to the app, where customers can see it.  Customers can log in to see the status of their clothes, find another dry cleaner, or look at the past transactions.
